 **Project: Star Wars**

**Description:**
This project is a simple HTML file that displays the title "Star Wars" in a web browser. It serves as a starting point for building a more complex web application related to the Star Wars franchise.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - A basic understanding of HTML and web development.
   - A text editor or IDE for writing code.
   - A web browser for viewing the results.

2. **Setting Up the Project:**
   - Create a new folder for the project and name it "star-wars".
   - Open your text editor or IDE and create a new file named "index.html".
   - Save the file in the "star-wars" folder.

3. **Writing the HTML Code:**
   - Open the "index.html" file in your text editor or IDE.
   - Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Star Wars</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

   - This code creates a basic HTML document with the title "Star Wars".
